# Concrete World 

A strange little game.

Game made with Phaser 3 (I highly recommend this tutorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game), pixel art created with https://www.piskelapp.com/. 

Background drawn & player sprite created by me, stock pixel flowers stolen from the internet, Gordo the spiky enemy stolen from Kirby, music stolen (with admiration) from Kikiyama's *YUME NIKKI*.
