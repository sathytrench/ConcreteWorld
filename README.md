# Concrete World 

A strange little game.

Game made with Phaser 3 (I highly recommend this tutorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game), pixel art created with https://www.piskelapp.com/. 

Background art drawn & sprites created by me, with background music by the talented Anna Cataldo.

1. fork
2. clone & `npm install`
3. windows: `npm run build-client-watch`, then `npm run start-server`
